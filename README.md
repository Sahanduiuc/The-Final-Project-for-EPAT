## 1. Research idea and motivation
#### * The project topic: Statistical Arbitrage: Pair trading in China’s Futures Markets.
Stocks cannot be shorted according to current China’s trading rules. Contrary to a more developed market, arbitrage opportunities are not readily realized which suggests there might be opportunities for those looking and able to take advantage of them. Therefore, I decided to focus on China’s futures market using Statistical Arbitrage and Pair trading techniques
#### * The strategy idea
The trading strategy implemented in this project is called “Statistical Arbitrage Trading”, also known as “Pairs Trading” which is a contrarian strategy designed to profit from the mean-reverting behavior of a certain pair ratio. The assumption behind this strategy is that the spread from pairs that show properties of co-integration is mean reverting in nature and therefore will provide arbitrage opportunities if the spread deviates significantly from the mean.
